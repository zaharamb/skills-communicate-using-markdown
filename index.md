Since the README.md doesn't update, I'm going to test by myself.

# H1 header (the biggest) (#)
## H2 header
### H3 header
#### H4 header
##### H5 header
###### H6 header (the smallest) (######)

Horizontal line: write "---", make sure to skip a line before and after

---

I can write:
- **bold text** : **;
- *italic text* : *;
- ***italic and bold text***: ***.

``To write code, use backticks: ` ``

Here an example: `println("test");`

> This is a blockquote. Use ' > '.

> ### This a quote written on multiples lines.
> A **line**.
> *Another* line.
> > A blockquote inside a blockquote (' > > ').
> 1. A list
> 2. Inside
> 3. A blockquote.

There're two different types of lists:

The ordered list:
1. Test
2. Test
3. Test

The dot list: (Use ' - ').
- Test
- Test
  1. List
  2. Inside
  3. Another list.
- Test


Add pictures: (Use this format: ! + [text] + (link to the file) )
![See this cute cat.](/cat.jpg)

To add a link, use this format: ! + [Title of the link] + (link)
